# Video-Player
This Git repository hosts a comprehensive video player web app built using modern web technologies. Here are some technical details about the implementation:

Key Technical Features:

Canvas Effects: The canvas feature leverages HTML5 <canvas> elements, allowing for real-time video effects.

Video Library Management: To handle the video gallery, I utilize JavaScript functions for managing video metadata, sorting, and filtering. Videos can be added to the gallery programmatically or through user interactions.

Subtitles Support: Subtitle rendering is implemented using JSON and JavaScript fucntions.

Video Upload: Uploading new videos is facilitated through HTML5 <input> elements.

Video Deletion: Videos can be deleted from the gallery through JavaScript-based user interactions.

Responsive Design: The web app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices and screen sizes. CSS media queries and responsive design principles are applied.

This repository is an excellent resource for developers looking to explore the technical aspects of building a video player web app.
